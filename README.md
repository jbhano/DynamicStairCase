Dynamic Stair Case Assignment

As a builder
I want to build dynamic staircases 
So that my business is more agile

We are building a dynamic staircase app where we can input the number of steps of a staircase we want. We call this N. N must be an integer.

Assume that N = 4. And we can do either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Which is a constant.
We can go from 0 -> 1 or from 0 -> 2 directly.
